1) This extension requires a Burp Suite Pro license.
2) You must initially load this file into the extension tab of Burp.
        This will perpetually keep it loaded in your burp configuration.
        This will have to be done for every new version of burp you have locally installed.
        Note: It is required that you provide the path to the Jython Jar file.
                This is installable via CentOS 6.5 by `yum install jython-2.2.1-4.8`
                The file is then located at `/usr/share/java/jython.jar`
3) Carbonator only runs if using the provided 'launch_burp.sh' script.
        usage: ./launch_burp.sh file_containing_list_of_urls_one_per_line
        This will open burp, run scan against the supplied information, generate the report, then close burp.
4) Provide your feedback, desired changes and code updates.

Please Note: Carbonator is available directly from within the Burp Suite Pro BApp Store.
